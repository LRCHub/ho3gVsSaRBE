I don't care if you buy it, I just want you to pay
Keep you there in my pocket 'cause you got in the way
I know you're so much better, do you understand?
I got your name on my sweater and your life in my hands

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

And I don't need my fuckin' money, I need you to pretend
Just a little simulation of being a friend
I think we all feel better when you play your game

Somebody's gotta say the things I'm trying not to say (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Somebody's gotta say the things I'm trying not to say (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Somebody's gotta say the things I'm trying not to say

Let's go out
You said, "I couldn't let my guard down no matter where I was"
Let's turn around
I'm so dramatic, it's a consequence of what I've done

(Ah-ah-ah) hold on, darling (oh)
I know a place where I won't be spotted (ah-ah-ah)
A perfect Pinterest garden (ah, ah, ah)
We'll get a job, two kids, restart it (ah-ah-ah)
And if you saw me (ah, ah, ah)
A stranger in the street, could you tell me you love me? (Ah-ah-ah)
Maybe we should both make real friends

Somebody's gotta say the things I'm trying not to say
Somebody's gotta say the things I'm trying not to say
Somebody's gotta say the things I'm trying not to say (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Somebody's gotta say the things I'm trying not to say (oh-oh, oh-oh)
