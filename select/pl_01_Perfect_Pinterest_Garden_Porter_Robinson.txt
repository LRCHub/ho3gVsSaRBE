I don't care if you buy it,
I just want you to pay
Keep you there in my pocket
'cause you got in the way
I know you're so much better,
do you understand?
I got your name on my sweater
and your life in my hands
Oh-oh, ah-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
And I don't need
my fuckin' money,
I need you to pretend
Just a little simulation of
being a friend
I think we all feel better
when you play your game
Somebody's gotta say the things
I'm trying not to say
Oh-oh, ah-oh
Somebody's gotta say the things
I'm trying not to say
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Somebody's gotta say the things
I'm trying not to say
Let's go out
You said
I couldn't let my guard
down no matter where I was
Let's turn around
I'm so dramatic,
it's a consequence of
what I've done
Oh, hold on, darling (Oh)
I know a place
where I won't be spotted
A perfect Pinterest garden
We'll get a job, two kids,
restart it, ah
And if you saw me
A stranger in the streets,
could you tell me you love me?
Maybe we should both make
real friends
Somebody's gotta say the things
I'm trying not to say
Somebody's gotta say the things
I'm trying not to say
Somebody's gotta say the things
I'm trying not to say
(Oh-oh, ah-oh)
Somebody's gotta say the things
I'm trying not to say
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
